Description: LaTeX class for drawing ER and HER diagramms.
 HERM-Pic is a LaTeX class for drawing entity-relationship and
 higher entity relationship diagramms.
 It supports the main ER diagramm syntax given by Heuer/Saake and
 also the main part of the HER diagramm syntax given by Bernhard 
 Thalheim. The schema drawing macros are a extension of the standard
 LaTeX picture environment, so the diagramms are easiely extendable
 by standard latex picture macros.
